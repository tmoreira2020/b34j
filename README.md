### Getting Started

It's really simple to use the parser, just create a object of `br.com.thiagomoreira.b3.HistoricReader` class and  start to invoke its methods. That's it!


```java
import br.com.thiagomoreira.b3.HistoricReader;
import br.com.thiagomoreira.b3.model.Candlestick;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    URL url = new URL("...");

    HistoricReader reader = new HistoricReader();

    List<Candlestick> candlesticks = reader.read(url);

    System.out.println(candlesticks.size());
}
```

### Which methods are implemented?

Yep, it is a small list. Can you help me? Look here: [Contributing](#contributing).
